LogicSage 1.2.1-2 in development!!!!

Features:
Light on features as I have rethought the applications UI. Clutter free is the new game! 

Fixes:
Proper window management! Drag and resize your windows to your hearts content, the windows should resize when required. Though this app is certainly best on iPadOS with a keyboard attached, to minimize the view size reducing, the app will also resize youre chats to fit in the area provided when keyboard is shown. :+1:
