There will be bugs

I'm working to resolve the issues with battery drain and multi-window behavior. I'm working to fix the apps performance when there is many windows or repositories of large size open.

ROADMAP:

I'm adding "write" git features to this app. You will be able to push and pull, git fetch and view commits, make a branch or a PR. A.I. Will be integrated in such a way that your commit messages and PR titles and descriptions and code such as documenation will be augmented with A.I. generated text.

Movies mode, Debate mode enhancements, and more!

What is it? A workspace, a git client, an AI project generator? A song maker? A debate practice tool? 
Help me decide!

Welcome to LogicSage. 

Now with GIT REPO SUPPORT!

Your precious API Keys are now stored in the Keychain :)

You can now enter a Github PAT in settings, then go to the Addiew and tap "Download sws repo" , hide the add view, once the download completes open the add view and browse away! Select files and drill down to check out the LogicSage mobile AI workspace code.

Another day full of excitement for LogicSage!

-You can now choose whatever gpt model you would like to use with the chat/completions API.
-It's starting out with gpt-3.5-turbo, but you can use gpt-4 too.

-Keep in mind you must manually set your GPT model in the Config of Swifty-GPT command line app. So go ahead and do that if you plan on using GPT-4. I've left it as gpt-3.5-turbo.

----
04-22-2023

SwiftSage evolves with real-time voice synthesis and Google command integration for enhanced SwiftSage features.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cdillard/SwiftSage.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SwiftSage`
3. Follow the [Installation](#installation) and [Configuration](#configuration) steps below.


## Configuration
1. Open `Swifty-GPT.xcworkspace`.
2. Set `OPEN_AI_KEY` in `GPT-Info.plist`.`
3. Enjoy!


## Installation
### Dependencies
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj)

- [Swift Toolchain Xcode 14.3](https://www.swift.org/download/)

#### Installing Homebrew and Ruby
If you don't have Homebrew and Ruby installed, follow these steps:
1. Install Homebrew by running: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
2. Install Ruby by running: `brew install ruby`

#### Installing XcodeGen and Xcodeproj
1. Install XcodeGen: `brew install xcodegen`
2. Install Xcodeproj: `gem install xcodeproj`

## SET API KEYS
SET API KEYS: You'll need to track down the following keys to fully experience SwiftSage.

NOTE: NYTIMES,PIXABAY, and GOOGLE are not required (yet) but be sure that the feat flags for those features are disabled in your Config for now if not using please.

```
	<key>GOOGLE_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>OPEN_AI_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>GOOGLE_SEARCH_ID</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>NYTIMES_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>NYTIMES_SECRET</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>PIXABAY_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
```

Check Config.swift for the config.

You can turn on asciiAnimations for fun or turn them off for fun. Your choice.

-More : Move InputText and IdeaText to your `~Documents/SwiftyGPTWorkspace/`, this will be your primary entry point for idea and gpt prompts. The xcode terminal does not support pasting multiple lines of code so this is the best way. Use gptFile, ideaFile to execute.

### Path Configuration
You may need to change the `xcodegenPath` variable depending on your configuration:
- Option 1: `let xcodegenPath = "/Users/$USERNAME/.rbenv/shims/xcodegen"`
- Option 2: `let xcodegenPath = "/opt/homebrew/bin/xcodegen"`

To discover your paths and issues, run:
- `which xcodeproj`
- `which xcodegen`
If you encounter Ruby errors, follow the steps here: [StackOverflow Solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31250347)

## COMMANDS
Check the following link for the Swifty-GPT server command list.
https://github.com/cdillard/SwiftSage/blob/main/Swifty-GPT/Command/CommandTable.swift


Check the following out for the much shorter list of iOS commands for mobile mode. (Working to add these all so server isn’t required)

## UNDERSTANDING THE SWIFT SAGE COMPONENTS!
![SwiftSage](Swifty-GPT/assets/swifty-diagram.png)

---
## SWIFT SAGE IOS INSTRUCTIONS: (Not needed unless you want to use SwiftSage on iOS/iPadOS devices)

DO NOT use wireless debuggin, it won't work due to websockety conflict

UPDATE the feat flag
`let swiftSageIOSEnabled = true`

If you have issues: `rm -rf WebSocketServer/.build`

TURN OFF YOUR FIREWALLS ON ALL USED DEVICES

1. Install Vapor: `brew install vapor`



USE THIS COMMAND TO RUN VAPOR SERVER

```
cd  WebSocketServer
rm -rf .build
vapor build
vapor run
```

## MAC SAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

MAC SAGE or SwiftSageForiOSForMac

I've included a mac OS app you can use for prompting, since the Xcode terminal is a bit rough.


## Troubleshooting

### Xcode build
`tessdata_fast-main` should be deleted from the Xcode project. It will be added to the SwiftyGPTWorkspace folder in your Documents dir.

---

### Microphone Access

NOTE: To enable the mic head to Config.swift and turn on `let voiceInputEnabled = true`


If you experience issues with microphone access/MIC POPUP, follow these steps:
1. Head to the Swifty-GPT folder and run the following command with your Apple Development account to stop the Mic popup:
Head to the Swifty-GPT folder and run this on the entitlements fil with your Apple Development account. This will stop the Mic POPUP.
 `codesign --entitlements Swifty-GPT.entitlements --force --sign "Apple Development: yourdevemail@gmail.com (YOUTEAXZM)" ../Xcode/DerivedData/Swifty-GPT-fsilcclqupwxmwfxejzmbhescakg/Build/Products/Release/Swifty-GPT`

![Microphone Access](Swifty-GPT/assets/MicAccess.png)

If you see dialogs such as "would like to use your Microphone" or "Would like to send events to other applications," please accept them.

Sometimes GPT will refuse to make apps....
```
Response non nil, another generation...
🤖: Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to develop an iOS app. My capabilities are limited to generating human-like text based on the given prompts.
found [] names
found [] commands
📁 found = 0
No names found... failing..
(Function)
```
If this happens just try again and it _usually_ clears right up.

## MAKING BUILT IN MAC OS VOICES THE BEST THEY CAN BE  (Not needed unless you want decent sounding voices)

If you would not like to hear ANYTHING from this tool please set `let voiceOutputEnabled = false`

-MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL POSSIBLE MAC OS VOICES INSTALLED BY GOING TO Settings -> Voice -> Spoken Content and downloading them all.

WANT A BETTER AND MORE REALISTIC SOUNDING VOICE????
```
// What YOU don't like the goofy robotic voices built in to Mac OS????
// DISABLED BY DEFAULT: SEE README AND https://www.cereproc.com
```
Just install the voices you want to Mac OS TTS, once they are installed check out their identifier in Sw-S with (5) and add them to the config.swift.

FIND/BUY/INSTALL THE VOICE YOU FANCY.
