## Getting Started

0. Welcome to LogicSage, an AI coding and chatting app! LogicSage is a 'Bring Your Own API Key' app. Before you can start chatting, you need to enter an OpenAI API Key (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 
	- To use the LogicSage app with AI, You must copy and paste your AI key into the textfield on the info screen that shows on first install. The Settings screen also contains a field you can enter your AI key into.
    - Please enter your API Key (via copy and paste) and it will be stored securely offline in your devices keychain. (Check the source code to verify this fact if you want).

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cdillard/LogicSage.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd LogicSage`
3. Follow the [Installation](#installation) and [Configuration](#configuration) steps below.


## Configuration
1. Open `Swifty-GPT.xcworkspace`.
