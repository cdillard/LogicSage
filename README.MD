## Description

### Powered by - [OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-3.5 turbo APIs], THANK YOU!

LogicSage is an open-source AI workspace for everyone. Chat w/ GPTs. Developers and AI enthusiasts can use it to work with gpts to view code, edit code, and submit PRs!

 [LogicSage: The Mobile AI Workspace](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logicsage/id6448485441) on the app store.

- This app is perfect for anyone who wants to get started with AI and learning how to prompt. 
- This app is also fantastic for developers who want to learn programming languages better using GPT.
- This app allows you to check out and examine this apps, or any git repositories source code. The source code viewing file windows are fully color customizable.
- This app allows you to talk with GPTs via views in the app.
- This app allows you to talk with chat API via a command line interface including a toolbar and a command bar.
- All you need is a A.I. API Key to be entered in the Settings menu.

Gist of modes: 
iOS app allows working in phone mode for interaction without a mac. 
more with the SwiftSage CLI for Mac including a server...
- Swift Vapor Server records GPT interaction and allows remote control of computer for building A.I. generated Xcode projects.
- Keep in mind this is an alpha project/app. Please email me or get in touch via support issues to help me finish this app.
- Integration with text to speech software in both the client and server.
- In computer mode: Debate mode: pit the GPT personas against one another with "debate" and "debate your topic‚Äù
---

Supported modes can be toggled in the Settings(gear icon) menu.

mobile: this mode allows you to interact with GPT by prefixing your prompt in the command entry window with the g key.

---

computer:  this more advanced mode allows you to create apps automatically in Xcode with the (i) command.

‚Äî-

Future of LogicSage:
Google and Link cmd support coming soon!

There will be bugs

I'm working to resolve the issues with battery drain and multi-window behavior. I'm working to fix the apps performance when there is many windows or repositories of large size open.

ROADMAP:

I'm adding "write" git features to this app. You will be able to push and pull, git fetch and view commits, make a branch or a PR. A.I. Will be integrated in such a way that your commit messages and PR titles and descriptions and code such as documenation will be augmented with A.I. generated text.

Movies mode, Debate mode enhancements, and more!

---

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cdillard/SwiftSage.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SwiftSage`
3. Follow the [Installation](#installation) and [Configuration](#configuration) steps below.


## Configuration
1. Open `Swifty-GPT.xcworkspace`.
2. Change to your Development Code Signing info.
2. Set `OPEN_AI_KEY` in `GPT-Info.plist`.`
3. Run `./run.sh` from within SwiftSage folder root to run the Swift Sage Server and Swifty-GPT server binary.
3. Enjoy!


## Installation
### Dependencies
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- [Xcodeproj](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj)

- [Swift Toolchain Xcode 14.3](https://www.swift.org/download/)

#### Installing Homebrew and Ruby
If you don't have Homebrew and Ruby installed, follow these steps:
1. Install Homebrew by running: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
2. Install Ruby by running: `brew install ruby`

#### Installing XcodeGen and Xcodeproj
1. Install XcodeGen: `brew install xcodegen`
2. Install Xcodeproj: `gem install xcodeproj`

## SET API KEYS
SET API KEYS: You'll need to track down the following keys to fully experience SwiftSage.

NOTE: NYTIMES,PIXABAY, and GOOGLE are not required (yet) but be sure that the feat flags for those features are disabled in your Config for now if not using please.

```
	<key>GOOGLE_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>OPEN_AI_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>GOOGLE_SEARCH_ID</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>NYTIMES_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>NYTIMES_SECRET</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>PIXABAY_KEY</key>
	<string></string>
```

Check Config.swift for the config.

You can turn on asciiAnimations for fun or turn them off for fun. Your choice.

-More : Move InputText and IdeaText to your `~Documents/SwiftyGPTWorkspace/`, this will be your primary entry point for idea and gpt prompts. The xcode terminal does not support pasting multiple lines of code so this is the best way. Use gptFile, ideaFile to execute.

### Path Configuration
You may need to change the `xcodegenPath` variable depending on your configuration:
- Option 1: `let xcodegenPath = "/Users/$USERNAME/.rbenv/shims/xcodegen"`
- Option 2: `let xcodegenPath = "/opt/homebrew/bin/xcodegen"`

To discover your paths and issues, run:
- `which xcodeproj`
- `which xcodegen`
If you encounter Ruby errors, follow the steps here: [StackOverflow Solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31250347)

## COMMANDS
Check the following link for the Swifty-GPT server command list.
https://github.com/cdillard/SwiftSage/blob/main/Swifty-GPT/Command/CommandTable.swift


Check the following out for the much shorter list of iOS commands for mobile mode. (Working to add these all so server isn‚Äôt required) 
https://github.com/cdillard/SwiftSage/blob/main/SwiftSageiOS/SwiftSageiOS/Command/CommandTable.swift




## UNDERSTANDING THE SWIFT SAGE COMPONENTS!
![SwiftSage](Swifty-GPT/assets/swifty-diagram.png)

---
## SWIFT SAGE IOS INSTRUCTIONS: (Not needed unless you want to use SwiftSage on iOS/iPadOS devices)

DO NOT use wireless debuggin, it won't work due to websockety conflict

UPDATE the feat flag
`let swiftSageIOSEnabled = true`

If you have issues: `rm -rf WebSocketServer/.build`

TURN OFF YOUR FIREWALLS ON ALL USED DEVICES

1. Install Vapor: `brew install vapor`



USE THIS COMMAND TO RUN VAPOR SERVER

```
cd  WebSocketServer
rm -rf .build
vapor build
vapor run
```

## MAC SAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

MAC SAGE or SwiftSageForiOSForMac

I've included a mac OS app you can use for prompting, since the Xcode terminal is a bit rough.


## Troubleshooting

### Xcode build
`tessdata_fast-main` should be deleted from the Xcode project. It will be added to the SwiftyGPTWorkspace folder in your Documents dir.

---

### Microphone Access

NOTE: To enable the mic head to Config.swift and turn on `let voiceInputEnabled = true`


If you experience issues with microphone access/MIC POPUP, follow these steps:
1. Head to the Swifty-GPT folder and run the following command with your Apple Development account to stop the Mic popup:
Head to the Swifty-GPT folder and run this on the entitlements fil with your Apple Development account. This will stop the Mic POPUP.
 `codesign --entitlements Swifty-GPT.entitlements --force --sign "Apple Development: yourdevemail@gmail.com (YOUTEAXZM)" ../Xcode/DerivedData/Swifty-GPT-fsilcclqupwxmwfxejzmbhescakg/Build/Products/Release/Swifty-GPT`

![Microphone Access](Swifty-GPT/assets/MicAccess.png)

If you see dialogs such as "would like to use your Microphone" or "Would like to send events to other applications," please accept them.

---
Sometimes GPT will refuse to make apps....
```
Response non nil, another generation...
ü§ñ: Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to develop an iOS app. My capabilities are limited to generating human-like text based on the given prompts.
found [] names
found [] commands
üìÅ found = 0
No names found... failing..
(Function)
```
If this happens just try again and it _usually_ clears right up.

## MAKING BUILT IN MAC OS VOICES THE BEST THEY CAN BE  (Not needed unless you want decent sounding voices)

If you would not like to hear ANYTHING from this tool please set `let voiceOutputEnabled = false`

-MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL POSSIBLE MAC OS VOICES INSTALLED BY GOING TO Settings -> Voice -> Spoken Content and downloading them all.

WANT A BETTER AND MORE REALISTIC SOUNDING VOICE????
```
// What YOU don't like the goofy robotic voices built in to Mac OS????
// DISABLED BY DEFAULT: SEE README AND https://www.cereproc.com
```
Just install the voices you want to Mac OS TTS, once they are installed check out their identifier in Sw-S with (5) and add them to the config.swift.

FIND/BUY/INSTALL THE VOICE YOU FANCY.

Another day full of excitement for LogicSage!

-You can now choose whatever gpt model you would like to use with the chat/completions API.
-It's starting out with gpt-3.5-turbo, but you can use gpt-4 too.

-Keep in mind you must manually set your GPT model in the Config of Swifty-GPT command line app. So go ahead and do that if you plan on using GPT-4. I've left it as gpt-3.5-turbo.
