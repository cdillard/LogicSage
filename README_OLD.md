## Getting Started with LogicSage: iOS, iPadOS, MacOS

#### Chat and copy code snippets:

0. Download LogicSage from the AppStore.[link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logicsage/id6448485441)
1. LogicSage is a 'Bring Your Own API Key' app. Before you can start chatting, you need to enter an OpenAI API Key (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) in the apps UI. 
    - it will be stored securely in your devices keychain. It will only be used when sending request to Open AI server (Check the source code in SettingsViewModel to check openAIKey handling.).

## Optional steps for additional features:

### Google Search API Integration: 

- Create a Google Custom Search API Key here. 

https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction

- Enter Google Search API Key and GooglE Search API Secret in Settings tab of app.
- Change model to `gpt-4-0314-web-browsing*` (this is added by LogicSage.)
