There will be bugs

I'm working to resolve the issues with battery drain and multi-window behavior. I'm working to fix the apps performance when there is many windows or repositories of large size open.

ROADMAP:

I'm adding "write" git features to this app. You will be able to push and pull, git fetch and view commits, make a branch or a PR. A.I. Will be integrated in such a way that your commit messages and PR titles and descriptions and code such as documenation will be augmented with A.I. generated text.

Movies mode, Debate mode enhancements, and more!

Another day full of excitement for LogicSage!

-You can now choose whatever gpt model you would like to use with the chat/completions API.
-It's starting out with gpt-3.5-turbo, but you can use gpt-4 too.

-Keep in mind you must manually set your GPT model in the Config of Swifty-GPT command line app. So go ahead and do that if you plan on using GPT-4. I've left it as gpt-3.5-turbo.
